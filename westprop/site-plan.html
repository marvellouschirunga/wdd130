      <h3>Our Developments</h3>
      <p>
        To date well over 2,300 serviced, surveyed and titled residential stands have been developed comprising in essence brand new communities within Harare, with all the required municipal services. The majority of our client’s properties now accommodate substantial middle to high income homes and have all compiled with City of Harare municipal by-laws to the highest standard. We have implemented our strategic plan of creating real estate valued in excess of US$500million and have commenced with project planning and infrastructural development of our land banks. Super-structure development of both residential and commercial properties has begun and significant strides have been made with projects in our portfolio completed whilst others are currently under development.
